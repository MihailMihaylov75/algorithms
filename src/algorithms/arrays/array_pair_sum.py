Problem:
Given an array of integers and a target sum, find the number of unique pairs
of integers in the array that add up to the target sum.

Example:
    array_pair_sum([1, 3, 2, 2], 4) -> 2
    # (1, 3) and (2, 2)

Constraints:
- Input array may contain positive or negative integers.
- Pairs are unordered: (a, b) is considered the same as (b, a).
- Each unique pair is counted only once.
