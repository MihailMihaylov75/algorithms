"""
Problem:
Compress a string by counting consecutive repeated characters (run-length encoding).
For example, "AAABCCDDDD" -> "A3B1C2D4". Empty input -> "".

Examples:
    compress_runs("AAABCCDDDD") -> "A3B1C2D4"
    compress_runs("ABA")        -> "A1B1A1"
    compress_runs("")           -> ""

Notes:
- This is classic run-length encoding (RLE) over consecutive runs.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the output string

Also provided (legacy behavior):
- string_compression(text): counts total occurrences per character in order of
  first appearance (NOT run-length). Kept for backward compatibility with the
  original repository version.
