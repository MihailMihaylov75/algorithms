"""
Problem:
Provide minimal linked-list node structures and common operations.

Singly-linked (SinglyNode):
- cycle_check(head): detect a cycle using Floyd's algorithm.
- reverse(head): reverse the list and return the new head.
- nth_to_last(head, n): return the n-th to last node (1-based; n=1 â†’ last).

Doubly-linked (DoublyNode):
- Minimal node data structure for completeness.

Examples:
    # Singly
    a = SinglyNode(1, SinglyNode(2, SinglyNode(3)))
    has_cycle = cycle_check(a)            # False
    new_head = reverse(a)                 # 3 -> 2 -> 1
    node = nth_to_last(new_head, 2)       # value 2

    # Doubly
    d1 = DoublyNode(10)
    d2 = DoublyNode(20, prev_node=d1)
    d1.next = d2

Notes:
- Educational implementations focused on clarity, not utilities.
- All operations are O(n) time, O(1) extra space unless stated otherwise.
