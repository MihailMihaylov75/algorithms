# Algorithms

These are solutions of some algorithms:
 - Anagram
 - Array pair
 - Find the missing element in two lists
 - Largest continues sum
 - Sequence reversal
 - Factorial
 - Fibonacci
 - String compression
 - Unique character in string finder
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Deque
 - Brackets validator(checks if each opening bracket has correct closing one)
 - Linked lists and doubly linked lists
 - Recursion examples
 - Queue to stack
 
 
 
 
 All the algorithms have common unit tests.
